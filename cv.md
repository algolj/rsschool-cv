### Briefly About Myself

Greetings, my name is Alexander, I am 24 years old. At the moment I work in a family business, but my soul is tempted to work by my master’s degree. Previously, I programmed purely for fun or to complete assignments at university. But I still want to start developing and working in commercial projects. And this is a completely different level of documentation, design, planning and code style. All this interests me very much.<details>Already after a month of successful graduation from the magistracy, something wrong began to happen to me. There was a strong need to help someone simplify math calculations by writing a couple of functions, and I also became addicted to programming streams. I had to go to a qualified physician to find out what the problem was. After I got tested, he told me:<br>
-Hmm ... I see such bad analyzes for the second time in my many years of practice.<br>
In the body, hormones of such groups as: <abbr title='Do a crutch, just to make it work!'>DcJMW</abbr>, <abbr title="I don't know why it works, but it does!">IdkWiWiD</abbr> and <abbr title='Hmm ... Is there a bug in my code or is it in the compiler?'>ITBiMCoC</abbr> My doctor prescribed treatment in the form of 2-3 tasks on Codewars per week, but this only helped to stop the progressive drop in indicators, yet not to get better. Seeing this, he’d said:<br>
-Things are bad, boy, you won't last half a year at this rate. You need to ... Hell, I didn't think I would ever do this again.<br>
He took a business card <sup>[proof](https://algolj.it/business-cаrd.jpg)</sup> from a drawer and handed it to me.<br>
-It's some sort of an anonymous programmers club, I think they can help you. Every day on their courses, the tasks become more and more difficult. Only a few will reach the end. I can only wish you good luck.<br>
That’s how I decided to thoroughly study the JavaScript / Frontend 2021Q3 course, because I don’t see the other option.</details>

### I know and have worked with (skills)

- HTML5;
- CSS3 ( SCSS (SASS), Bootstrap, BEM methodology);
- JavaScript (Fundamentals, ES6+, DOM, JSON);
- React (Redux);
- Vue.JS (basic knowledge);
- Node.JS (basic knowledge, Express.JS);
- Git (basic knowledge);
- SQL (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Access);
- Java (basic knowledge);
- Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator (In this webpage i made diploma icons[\*](#Education)), Lightroom;
- Figma;
- Postman (basic knowledge).

### Preferred vector of development

Of course, even a third of frontend technologies cannot be well known and applied in practice by one person. But many tasks cannot be realized solely on the basis of frontend tools. Therefore, in the future, after confident mastering of React (Next.js), I would like to properly learn backend technologies (multithreading, working with documents and folders on the server, optimizing SQL queries, etc.). In the master's degree, I’ve had experience in creating basic client-server applications based on the PERN stack (database development and hierarchical data clustering using third-party libraries. The main task was to work with Express.JS requests and Postman) and I’ve liked it.

### Small code from me

##### [Best travel](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55e7280b40e1c4a06d0000aa 'link to kata')

John and Mary want to travel between a few towns A, B, C ... Mary has on a sheet of paper a list of distances between these towns. ls = [50, 55, 57, 58, 60]. John is tired of driving and he says to Mary that he doesn't want to drive more than t = 174 miles and he will visit only 3 towns.

Which distances, hence which towns, they will choose so that the sum of the distances is the biggest possible to please Mary and John?

```Javascript
  function chooseBestSum(t, k, ls) {
  //create a variable that chronizes
  //the result of calculations
  let result = 0;
  //exit the function if there is no correct input element
  if(k > ls.length || k<=0 || t<=0) return null;

//recursive function calculates the best route
// st - index of the city in question to visit in the array
// arr - an array with cities that are considered
// for visiting on this passage
let recurs = (st, arr) => {

      //if there are enough cities to visit
      if (arr.length == k){
        //calculate the distance of the route between them
        let summ = arr.reduce((x,y) => x+y , 0);
        //if it is not greater than or equal to
        //the required length of the route
        //and more than the current maximum route
        //write the distance to 'result' and exit recursion
        if (summ <= t && result < summ) result = summ;
        return;
      }

      //create a new city in arr and call recursion
      //for the given combination of cities
      for (let i = st; i < ls.length; i++){
        arr.push(ls[i]);
        recurs(i+1, arr);
        arr.pop();
      }
    };

//calculate the best route
recurs(0, []);

//return the best route, if any, or null
return result || null;
}
```
